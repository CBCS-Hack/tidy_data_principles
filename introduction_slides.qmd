## Getting started

This session assumes you have installed R and RStudio.

Install R for [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).

## Using Git and Github

-   Git is an open source version control software. It tracks changes you make within a project, and records the versions of documents created.
-   Github is an online interface that allows your to store, manage, and easily share your code.
-   Github is therefore a powerful tool for open and reproducible science.
