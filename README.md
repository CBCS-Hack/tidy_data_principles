# tidy_data_principles

This repository forms the basis of the workshop on tidy and reproducible code for R.

The ReadMe is an important file in the repository but regularly gets neglected. This is where you can tell would-be users of your code how your repository works, how they need to use it to make your work reproducible, where any additional large data is stored that is not suitable for github (very common).

# Scripts

Most scripts for this project are located in the main project folder with this ReadMe. But one is found in the scripts folder to demonstrate how you can store your scripts effectively in different locations.

| Script                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 1_setting_up.Rmd                  | This script has two functions. The first is to collect resources to get readers using git, github and ssh keys. The second is demonstrate that R markdowns can be used purely to leave notes without even using code. They are working documents with multiple purposes.                                                                           |
| 2_using_rmarkdown_quarto_docs.Rmd | This script shows how you can walk readers through your code and methodology in a logical and easy to read fashion using Rmarkdown documents. The new generation of Rmarkdown is Quarto so I would encourage you to install it and give Quarto documents a go. These tools are so much more user-friendly than a busy and poorly labelled R script |
| 3_organise_your_data              | This scripts walks through how, rather than having data files scattered everywhere, we can create multiple folders for files at different stages of processing within your analysis - see "Data" heading below. The same applies to figures.                                                                                                       |
